# Flask Market App

This project was developed using Python Flask Framework, with HTML/CSS frontend.

I followed youtube playlist by JimShapedCoding, where he teaches Flask from scratch and in depth.

Concepts of Modularity and Packaging were also covered, the it uses a sqlite database.

Jinja Templating was used to make it a dynamic application.

Some of the libraries of Flask Framework used are: wtforms, SQLAlchemy and LoginManager
