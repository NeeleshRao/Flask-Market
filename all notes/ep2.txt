Templates are used to keep the html files separately, and use them as and when required, as we cannot store 
all of them in a string.

Correct practice is to store all the html files in a 'templates' folder in the same directory 
as the main python app file.

return render_template('file_name.html')

For the html base page along with bootsrap and other necessary stuff, go to bootstrap starter template, and
edit the version to whatever is needed(4.5), and copy-paste the code into the home/base html page.

To create multiple routes, i.e. if we want two different url's using the same function/performing the same action:
@app.route('/')
@app.route('/home')
just place them below each other.

to set dark mode:
after the closing body tag, put
<style>
    body{
        background-color: #212121;
        color: white;
    }
</style>
