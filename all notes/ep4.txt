Template inheritance using jinja:
Allows to have a base html that will be common across all pages designed, by simple inheritance 
wherever required.

The way to extend the base template to a derived webpage:
{% extends 'base.html' %}

We can create blocks in the base html, so that different web-pages can place different content in them.
in the base html,

{% block title %}
{% endblock %}

In the derived/dynamic webpage,
{% block title %}
	Title for the webpage.
{% endblock %}

jinja also offers way of pointing to url's which can be used in navbar.
we can do--
<a href="{{url_for('home_page')}}"......
instead of hardcoding the url for the home page, this way even if the url
name changes, the function name associated with it will not change, so it makes this dynamic.
