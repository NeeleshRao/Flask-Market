Setting up the environment :
1- mkdir wherever needed
2- pip install flask
3- flask --version

Create a new file/ the main app(python file).
Create a minimal application.
@app.route() --> decorator

route : What url should the following actions be performed on
/ : root url of the website

To setup the app:
1. set FLASK_APP=market.py , here the market.py should be replaced by the main python file.
2. flask run

(or)

1. do -->python app.py in the cmd, where app is replaced by the correct python app file name.

To turn on debug mode(continually refreshes the server on reloading, so that we don't have to manually do it) :
set FLASK_DEBUG=1

To create dynamic routes:
We cannot always know/ cannot hardcode the urls, for eg-facebook will not know the url pages for all it's customers.
Here, dynamic routing is used.

@app.route("/about/<username>")
def about_page(username):
    return f"<h1>This page is about user : {username} </h1>"
