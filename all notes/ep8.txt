To create dynamic forms with flask :
>> pip install flask-wtf
>> pip install wtforms
Create a new python file -- forms.py

from flask_wtf import FlaskForm
from wtforms import StringField, PasswordField

class RegistrationForm(FlaskForm):
    username = StringField(label="username")
    email_address = StringField(label="email")
    password1 = PasswordField(label="password1")
    password2 = PasswordField(label="password2")
    submit = SubmitField(label='submit')


Next, we have to create a route for this form.
from market.forms import RegistrationForm\

@app.route("/register")
def register_page():
    form = RegistrationForm()
    return render_template("register.html", form = form)

next create an html file, called register.html, and remember to use jinja syntax.

It is very important to generate a secret key, fpor displaying forms.

Go to the python prompt and type this.
>>> import os
>>> os.urandom(12).hex()
'2798397170021b1e87fc9401'

That is the secret key generated.

Go to __init__.py and use the app.config

app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = '2798397170021b1e87fc9401'

Next, we have to create the register.html.
In the content block, put :

<div class="container">
    <form method="POST" class="form-register" style="color: white;">
        {{ form.username.label()}}
        {{ form.username(class = 'form-control', placeholder = "Enter UserName") }}
    </form>
</div>

POST method is used whenever there are some changes/interactions to be made in the database.

The rest focusses on creating the register.html page
