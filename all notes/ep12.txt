Many libraries have to be installed for the login system.

pip install flask_login

In the init.py file

from flask_login import LoginManager
login_manager = LoginManager(app)

User_loader exception:


@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(user_id):
    return User.get(user_id)

Paste this in models.py

from flask_login import UserMixin --> This will take care of some things we need to code to ensure
that the user is logged in across all webpages.

This is to clear the database

>>> from market.models import User
>>> from market import db
>>> db.drop_all()
>>> db.session.commit()
>>> db.create_all()
>>> db.session.commit()
