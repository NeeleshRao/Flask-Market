Flask provides flash that will provide pop-up messages for the users.

from flask import flash
Instead of printing the error in server side, do
flash("Error message ")

To display flash messages, we have to put it in the base.html.
Basically, we have to assign the area for showing the flashed messages.

Put it below the navbar
{% with messages = get_flashed_messages( with_categories=true ) %}

It is important to check if the username entered in the registration form is unique

FlaskForm checks if any functions start with validate_ and the part after this also is read
and it validates it by itself.
