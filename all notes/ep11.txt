This is needed to store the passwords securely
pip install flask_bcrypt

In the init.py file,
from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
Next, we have to initialize it in the inint.py file

bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)

Getters and setters will help us change how we recieve an attribute in OOP.

So, we need to make changes in the models.py file.

from market import bcrypt

@property
def password(self):
	return self.password

@password.setter
def password(self, plain_text_password):
	self.password_hash = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(plain_text_password).decode('UTF-8')

In the routes.py, go to the place where we have initialised the user class.
and instead of password_hash, change it to password.


Next, we have to create login forms..
