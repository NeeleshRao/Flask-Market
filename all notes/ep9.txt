In the routes.py file:

to access the registration page and it's elements -

if form.validate_on_submit() --> ensures that the actions take place only on submitting the form.

to protect the information when travelling from host to client and vide versa, 
Flask provides a safety feature.

just below the form declaration tag,
{{ form.hidden_tag() }} --> This generates a random token

It is important to perform flask validations for the form data:

from wtforms.validators import Length, EqualTo

in the forms.py file
add validators like--
validators=Length(min=2, max = 30) or validators=EqualTo('password1')

Multiple validators can be put together in a list

If any of the validations fail, it will not enter the validate_on_submit part, instead it will be 
stored in the form of a dictionary form.errors

So just check that form.errors != {}
